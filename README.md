## Planning and Building process 

I aproached creating this app by making a approximate time plan of the process i first set up my server side curls & routes and schema and then focused on Client side. On client side I first added all athentication forms and affirmation create & update froms to html, i used Jquery for event handling and ui flow and used ajax for handling api requests and responses from server side. in the end i sued css to add background image and aligning the forms and data resources.
